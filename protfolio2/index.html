        <div class="content">
            I am Paul Sajo, the creator and founder of 
            Peckwoods , a Social networking platform, 
            currently pursuing my B.tech in Computer 
            Science and Engineering at Christ University, 
            Bangalore, India. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I am highly motivated research oriented senior 
            developer. I also have authored many open-source libraries and tutorials. Besides 
            programming I also have also done quite a bit of 
            3d modeling using Blender, illustrations using 
            Inkscape, image editing using Gimp and UI designs using Adobe xd. When I am not working 
            on any projects I usually help other developers in Stack overflow community.
            <br>
            <br>
            I always prefer to work on new and something 
            that I have not worked with before. I usually work 
            alone, but when I am assigned a team I prefer to 
            work in small group with highly motivated 
            people. I am also a believer of "Too many cooks 
            spoil the broth".

Users can draw connection between nodes to depict inheritance. Once the users is satisfied with the design, user can click on generate to generate the python equivalent code.
